Problem Statement : 360-degree feedback software for the Government of India related News Stories in Regional Media using Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Description :
The Press Information Bureau (PIB) is the nodal agency of the Government of India to disseminate information on government policies, programs, initiatives, and achievements to the print and electronic media. It functions as an interface between the Government and the media and provides feedback to the Government on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reactions as reflected in the media. Information is disseminated from Hqrs through Press Releases in English, Hindi, and Urdu and subsequently translated from PIB Regional offices into other Indian languages like Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Assamese, and Manipuri, to reach out to about 8,400 newspapers and media organizations across the country. To provide effective and timely feedback to the Government, an automated feedback system for all the above regional languages using Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning is required. The feedback system should crawl the select regional media sites (around 200 websites) for the news published in regional languages. The software should categorize the stories into the concerned departments as per the tags provided. The stories should be categorized as favorable (positive), neutral, or not favorable (negative) to the Government of India. Negative stories pertaining to a department should be notified to the concerned PIB officer on a real-time basis by SMS or Android notification or by other means. E-papers of select newspapers should be scanned by the system automatically using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The concerned news clippings if it pertains to the Government of India should be cut and electronically pasted in a pre-designed template mentioning the name of the newspaper, the page number where the story was published, the name of the edition, etc. These clippings should be classified into Departments and tonality (positive, negative, and neutral). Also in the dashboard, the title of the newspapers should be displayed and the stories should be in a position to be sorted/filtered using the variables like Tonality, Edition, etc. The system should also crawl through the YouTube channels of select news channels and identify the portion of the news bulletin pertaining to the Government of India using closed captioning. If closed captioning is not available, should use audio to text feature to capture the transcript. Once the portion of the video is identified, the said video has to be categorized into Departments and tonality. If the story is negative, the concerned PIB officer should get the notification immediately.
